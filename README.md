# HHbbtautau_boosted

This is the repository used for the Run3 HH->bbtautau analysis in the boosted topology. It includes important features and useful functions such as semi-invisible mass reconstruction methods.

The readme file is under development, but you can find the example script in the test_run.sh file.

This tool is developed based on the [nanoaod-base-analysis](https://nanoaod-base-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Framework.
